## Issues/ Missing Features
* As a user i'd like to be able to edit a track's info after it's been added
* As a user i want the playlist to automatically search online and find matching album art when i fill in a track's title and artist
* As a user i'd like to add multiple tracks at once by selecting a music folder on my computer,  
the playlist should then automatically extract the song info for each mp3 file in my folder
* As a user when I double tap a track in the playlist, i'd like the playlist to play that track
